# PostgreSQL 9.4

This is a Vagrant build for [PostgreSQL 9.4](http://www.postgresql.org/) with the optional [Postgis](http://postgis.net/) extension also installed.

I created it for use in local development when I need a PostgreSQL database, rather than install and run Postgres directly on my dev machine.
